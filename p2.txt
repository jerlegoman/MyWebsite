I quickly started thinking of ways I could create such a concept. I didn’t want to use an IP camera because it would be easy for me to share the stream with others. I decided to use a computer and a USB webcam to operate it. I took an old laptop (Dell Inspirion 1501) from my grandparents’ house. I bought an HD Webcam (Logitech HD Pro C920) from eBay for about $48. The computer has outdated specs for 2016 standards. It originally shipped with Windows Vista but I upgraded it to Windows 7 around 2010 or 2011. It contains a AMD Athlon 64 X2 32-bit processor from about 2005 and has 2 Slots of RAM each 512 MB (1 GB total).
