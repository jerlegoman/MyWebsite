<p class="text-white-50">This article was written over a period of several dates.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">           I originally got the idea for this project when I was watching the Kotel cam
        (The live stream of the Western Wall). Other webcams such as the times square cam furthered
        my inspiration. I thought to myself, “What if I could create my own live stream of interesting scenery.”
        During the month of January, my family flies to my Grandparents apartment in Aventura, FL. Their window faces
        a brilliant view of the Intercostal right before Golden Beach with boats moving by. Seeing this view is one of
        my most favorite things about coming to Florida. I realized that this is perfect for a scenery live cam. I could
        be at home in New York watching the window from my computer counting the days till the day we leave. I also
        wanted others to enjoy the beautiful scenery as the boats float by.</p>
